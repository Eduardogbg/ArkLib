# Numeric ε-error functions: ε_ca and ε_mca

Numeric versions of the proximity gap, correlated agreement (CA), and mutual correlated
agreement (MCA) error functions as defined in
*Open Problems in List Decoding and Correlated Agreement*
(Arnon, Boneh, Fenzi; April 8, 2026), Section 4.

This file implements the **numeric error-function API** for CA and MCA. It coexists with the
predicate-style API in [`Basic.lean`](Basic.lean); each predicate has a bridging
`*_iff_eps*_le` lemma elsewhere in this directory.

## Main definitions

- `ProximityGap.epsPG` — proximity gap error, introduced informally in paper §4.1.
- `ProximityGap.epsCA` — ABF26 Definition 4.1: correlated agreement error
  `ε_ca(C, δ_fld, δ_int)`.
- `ProximityGap.epsCA'` — Convenience alias for the no-proximity-loss case
  `ε_ca(C, δ) := ε_ca(C, δ, δ)`.
- `ProximityGap.epsMCA` — ABF26 Definition 4.3: mutual correlated agreement error.

## Note on MCA with proximity loss (ABF26 Remark 4.4)

The paper intentionally does **not** define a proximity-loss variant of `ε_mca` analogous to
`ε_ca(C, δ_fld, δ_int)`. Per Remark 4.4 this remains to be thoroughly explored, so this file
exposes only the no-loss `ε_mca(C, δ)`.

## Open follow-ups

The following items from ABF26 Section 4 are tracked in `ABF26_PLAN.md` §7 and remain to be
added on top of this file's definitions. Each is in scope for Phase 1 of the plan:

- **Monotonicity / antitonicity of `epsCA`** (ABF26-D4.1 sub-tasks 4–5). `epsCA` is
  *monotone* in `δ_fld` (larger fold-distance ⇒ more `γ` in the event) and **antitone**
  in `δ_int` (larger interleaved-distance ⇒ stricter `Δ_joint > δ_int` condition).
- **ABF26 Remark 4.2** — discretization: `epsCA C δ (δ + β) = epsCA C δ (δ + β')` for
  `β, β' ∈ [0, 1/n)`. Follows from `Δ ∈ {0, 1/n, ..., 1}`.
- **ABF26 Fact 4.5** — `ε_pg ≤ ε_ca ≤ ε_mca`. Requires defining `epsPG` first.
- **ABF26 Lemma 4.6** — `ε_mca = ε_ca` below `δ_min(C)/2`. Proof leans on the helper
  predicates `pairJointAgreesOn` and `mcaEvent` defined here.
- **ABF26 Lemma 4.7** — `ε_mca(C^≡t, δ) ≤ t · ε_mca(C, δ)` via union bound.
- **Bridging lemmas**: `δ_ε_correlatedAgreementAffineLines C δ ε ↔ epsCA C δ δ ≤ ε` (and
  similar for `Curves`, `AffineSpaces`) connecting the predicate API in `Basic.lean` to the
  numeric API here.

## Design notes worth flagging

- **`F` is implicit in `epsCA` but does not appear in its return type**, so callers that
  invoke `epsCA` without an explicit pair `(f₁, f₂)` (e.g. inside `epsCA'`) need
  `epsCA (F := F) C δ δ` to thread `F` through. If this becomes painful in proofs,
  switching `epsCA` to take `F` as an explicit argument is a cheap refactor.
- **`epsMCA` and `mcaEvent` are `Fin 2`-only** (the affine-line case). Paper Section 4
  considers more general interleavings; generalizing to `Fin ℓ` is a future extension,
  not required for F4.5 or L4.6.
- **`pairJointAgreesOn` and `mcaEvent` are intentionally public**, exposed as named
  anchors for the planned L4.6 proof and bridging lemmas. If they prove unhelpful in
  practice they can be inlined / marked `private`.

for which a line `f₁ + γ·f₂` is `δ`-close to `C` while the line is *not* entirely `δ`-close.

Paper §4.1 page 17 introduces this informally: a code has proximity gap `ε_pg(C, δ)` if
every line is either entirely `δ`-close to `C` (i.e. every `γ ∈ F` gives a δ-close point)
or at most `ε_pg` fraction of it is — a dichotomy. The strict comparison with `ε_ca`
(`epsPG ≤ epsCA`, paper Fact 4.5) is that the "bad" set for `epsPG` (`¬ ∀ γ, line close`)
is contained in the "bad" set for `epsCA` (`¬ jointProximity`) when `C` is closed under
linear combination, since any joint codeword pair `(v₀, v₁)` produces a line of codewords
`v₀ + γ·v₁ ∈ C`. -/

The worst-case probability over pairs of words `(f₁, f₂)` and over `γ ← $ᵖ F` that

- the pair `(f₁, f₂)` is **not** `δ_int`-close to the interleaved code `C^⋈ (Fin 2)`.

The second condition is `γ`-independent, so the formula simplifies to `0` when `(f₁, f₂)`
is jointly close, and to the line probability otherwise. Cf. paper Section 4.1. -/

/-- **ABF26 Definition 4.3.** Mutual correlated agreement (MCA) error.

The worst-case probability over pairs `(f₁, f₂)` and over `γ ← $ᵖ F` of the
`mcaEvent`: a single set `S` of size `≥ (1-δ)·n` witnesses both that the line
`f₁ + γ·f₂` exactly equals some codeword of `C` on `S` **and** that no joint pair
of codewords agrees with `(f₁, f₂)` on `S`. MCA strengthens CA (Definition 4.1)
by requiring the witness set for closeness and non-agreement to coincide.

Per Remark 4.4, the paper intentionally does not define a proximity-loss variant. -/

/-! ## Helpers toward ABF26 Fact 4.5

Fact 4.5 says `ε_pg ≤ ε_ca ≤ ε_mca`. The first inequality requires the underlying code to
be closed under linear combination, so we state the helper lemmas with a `Submodule F (ι → A)`
hypothesis. -/

/-- **Helper for ABF26 Fact 4.5.** If the pair `(u 0, u 1)` is jointly `δ`-close to the
interleaved code from a `Submodule` `MC`, then for *every* scalar `γ`, the line
`u 0 + γ • u 1` is `δ`-close to `MC`. The proof uses the witness codeword pair
`(v 0, v 1)` to build a single line of codewords `v 0 + γ • v 1 ∈ MC`. -/

/-- **ABF26 Fact 4.5, first inequality.** `ε_pg ≤ ε_ca` for a `Submodule F (ι → A)`.

Pointwise on `u : WordStack A (Fin 2) ι`:

- If `jointProximity` holds, every `γ` gives a δ-close line (by
  `jointProximity_imp_line_close`), so the `epsPG` contribution is 0; `epsCA`'s contribution
  is also 0 (its `if jointProximity` branch).
- Otherwise both contributions collapse to the same `Pr_γ[line δ-close]` because the inner
  expression is syntactically identical and the bad-set conditions both fail or both hold. -/

Pointwise on `u`:

- If `jointProximity`, `epsCA`'s contribution is 0, ≤ anything.
- Otherwise we apply `Pr_le_Pr_of_implies` with the fact that "line δ-close to `MC`" implies
  `mcaEvent MC δ (u 0) (u 1) γ` (in the `¬jointProximity` regime): the witness set `S` for
  the line-close fact has size `≥ (1-δ)·n` and is automatically *not* a joint-agreement
  set (because if it were, `jointProximity` would hold via the equivalence
  `jointAgreement_iff_jointProximity`). -/
