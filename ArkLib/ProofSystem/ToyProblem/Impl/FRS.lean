# Toy problem — folded Reed–Solomon instantiation (ABF26 §6.3.2)

The second concrete leaderboard entry for the §6 toy-problem frontier: take the
underlying code to be a **folded** Reed–Solomon code `FRS[F, L, k, s, ω]` with
folding parameter `s > 1`, so a codeword symbol is a length-`s` tuple
`Fin s → F` rather than a scalar `F` (ABF26 Definition 2.15 [GR08]). This is the
`A = Fin s → F` instantiation of the alphabet-generic toy problem (the `A = F`
scalar case is the interleaved-RS entry `koalaIRS` in `Leaderboard.lean`).

Folding is the lever behind the paper's §6.3.2 *subspace-design* analysis: the
`τ`-subspace-design list-decodability of FRS (`τ(r) = s·ρ/(s − r + 1)`) drives
the list-size term, and the construction's **argument-size at enforced 128-bit
security** improves over interleaved RS for large folding. We record **two**
KoalaBear-sextic FRS leaderboard rows from `tab:subspace-design-security-analysis`
/ `tab:subspace-elias-lowerbound-thresholds` (both at `t = 128`):

* the **`s = 2^5 = 32` row** — the paper's primary fully-worked example
  (`securityGap = 98.91` bits; see `securityGap_koalaFRS`); and
* the **`s = 2^12 = 4096` row** — the large-folding, **gap-closing** row
  (`securityGap = 10.62` bits; see `securityGap_koalaFRS12`), demonstrating that
  larger folding pushes the τ-subspace-design operating point toward capacity and
  collapses the fixed-`t` δ-swept gap by `≈ 88` bits.

## The `s = 32` row at `t = 128` (ABF26 §6.3.2)

* Field `F = KoalaSextic` (`|F| = q^6 ≈ 2^186`), rate `ρ = 1/2`, evaluation
  domain `|L| = 2^16`, message size `k = 2^20`, folding `s = 2^5 = 32`
  (so `k = 2^20 ≤ s·|L| = 2^21`).
* **Provable** RBR knowledge soundness (X side, `tab:subspace-design-security-`
  `analysis`, `r = 8`, at `δ = 7/48`): `bestProvableError ≤ 2^(-29.10)` — the
  convex combination of the spot-check term `(τ(r+1) + 3/(2r))^128 = (41/48)^128
  = 2^(-29.1085)` and the list-size term `≈ 2^(-166.8)`. The certified figure
  rounds the magnitude **down** to `29.10` (the convex combination dominates the
  spot-check term, so `2^(-29.1085)` is a strict ceiling; `29.11` would
  *overstate*, as `2^(-29.1085) > 2^(-29.11)`) — the same round-down discipline
  as the interleaved `koalaIRS` anchor (`64 → 63.99`).
* **Attack** (Y side): `bestProvableError ≥ 2^(-128.01)`. This is the **sweep
  floor** `⨅_δ (1-δ)^t + …`, certified from the **spot-check term alone** — the
  convex combination dominates `(1-δ)^t`, whose infimum over the window
  `(0, δ_min)` is `(1-δ_min)^128 ≈ 2^(-128.006)` because the folded code's MDS
  relative distance `δ_min = D/|L| = 32769/65536 ≈ 0.50002` (a degree-`< k`
  polynomial has `< k` roots, hence `< (k-1)/s = 32767` zero folded-symbols).
  No Elias/list-size lower bound is needed for this ceiling. The paper's
  per-`δ*` Elias value (`tab:subspace-elias-lowerbound-thresholds`, `δ* = 0.499`)
  is the *weaker* point reading `2^(-127.63) = (1-0.499)^128`; it is **not** the
  sweep floor (just above `δ*` the spot-check keeps dropping toward `2^(-128)`,
  so `2^(-127.63)` is not a valid floor unless the list-size term is active
  across the whole `(δ*, δ_min)` sliver — the same sub-band subtlety that bumped
  the interleaved ceiling `116.49 → 117`). The ceiling rounds **up** to `128.01`.
* `securityGap = 128.01 − 29.10 = 98.91` bits.

**Reading the gap honestly.** At a *fixed* `t = 128`, `s = 32` folding gives a
*larger* `bestProvableError` gap than the interleaved entry (`koalaIRS`:
`53.01`). This is faithful, not a defect: folding at fixed `t` does not by
itself improve the δ-swept provable frontier (for `s ≤ 2^4` the paper proves
*no* soundness at all at `t = 128`). The FRS advantage lives on a **different
axis** the toy `bestProvableError` (a fixed-`t` δ-sweep) does not capture:

* **larger folding closes the gap** — at `s = 2^12` the provable side reaches
  `2^(-118.14)` (`r = 108`), a `≈ 10`-bit gap to the `≈ 2^(-128)` attack; and
* **argument-size at enforced 128-bit security** — the `s = 2^5` row reaches
  full `2^(-128.03)` provable soundness at repetition `t = 563`, `r = 8` with
  argument size `417.9 KiB` (`tab:subspace-design-128bit-security`), the metric
  on which folding genuinely beats interleaving.

Both anchors are **full reductions** down to named externals (the sorry-free
integer spot-check leaves `koalaFRS_spotcheck` / `koalaFRS_spotcheck_lb` /
`koalaFRS_combine` plus the proven L6.10 bridge), matching the `koalaIRS` anchors.
The attack ceiling owes a *single* external — the folded MDS relative distance
`koalaFRS_minRelDist` (`δ_min = 32769/65536`); the provable bound owes the
τ-subspace-design `ε_mca` term, the FRS counterpart of the `koalaIRS` owed `ε_mca`
(see `frsLowerBound` / `frsUpperBound_attack`).

contains an element of order `2^24 ≥ 2^21`. It is owed *only* because
multiplicative-order facts over the **noncomputable** `GaloisField KoalaBear.fieldSize 6`

folded evaluation points `{α · ω^i}` are pairwise distinct) together with
`k ≤ s·|L|` (here `2^20 ≤ 32·2^16 = 2^21`): a degree-`< k` polynomial vanishing
on `s·|L| ≥ k` distinct points is zero, so the unfolded evaluation — hence
`frsEvalOnPoints` on `degreeLT k` — would be injective. `koalaFRSDomain` is

leaderboard — is exercised at a true folding parameter `s = 2^5`.

Reduced to the integer fact `41^128·2^29·125 ≤ 116·48^128` (`log₁₀`: `128·1.6128 +

`#eval`. (True value `(41/48)^128 ≈ 2^(-29.1085)`; the `2^(-29)·116/125 ≈
2^(-29.106)` ceiling leaves room for the list-size term below `2^(-29.10)`.)

**Maintainer note — tuned split, thin margin.** The integer core holds with ratio
`≈ 1.0005`; the constants `116/125` here and `1/200` in the `ε_mca` admit are
co-tuned so that `116/125 + 1/200 = 933/1000` closes against `2^(-0.10)` in
`koalaFRS_combine` (also razor-thin, `≈ 1.00035`). Do **not** nudge either constant
without re-checking both integer inequalities in python — they are individually
correct but have little slack. -/

/-- **Folded-RS provable lower bound (`29.10` bits) at the KoalaBear/`s=32`/`t=128`
point.** Cites the §6.3.2 subspace-design analysis
(`tab:subspace-design-security-analysis`, `s = 2^5`, minimizing `r = 8`). As with
`arklib_lowerBound_irs_t128`, the proof is a **full formalized derivation down to
named owed externals** (no longer an opaque `sorry`):

1. **Pick `δ := 7/48`** — the `r = 8` τ-subspace-design operating point (`τ(r+1) =
   τ(9) = s·ρ/(s−r+1) = 32·(1/2)/(32−9+1) = 2/3`, spot-check `1−δ = τ(9)+3/(2r) =
   2/3+3/16 = 41/48`). Admissible: `0 < 7/48 < δ_min = 32769/65536`
   (`koalaFRS_minRelDist`). The lower bound is an infimum, so one admissible δ
   suffices (`bestProvableError_le`).
2. **Spot-check term** `(1−δ)^128 = (41/48)^128 ≤ 2^(-29)·(116/125)` — proven
   sorry-free in `koalaFRS_spotcheck` (integer fact `41^128·2^29·125 ≤ 116·48^128`).
3. **`winningSetSoundness` term** — bounded by the **proven** L6.10 bridge
   `winningSetSoundness_le_epsMCA_add` down to `ε_mca(C, 7/48) + |Λ|/|F|`, which the
   single owed external τ-subspace-design admit caps at `2^(-29)·(1/200)` (the
   actual subspace-design list-size figure is `≈ 2^(-166.8)`, far below this).
4. The convex combination is then `≤ 2^(-29)·(116/125 + 1/200) = 2^(-29)·(933/1000)
   ≤ 2^(-29.10)` (`koalaFRS_combine`, integer fact `2·933^10 ≤ 1000^10`).

**Why `bits := 29.10`, not `29.11`.** `(41/48)^128 = 2^(-29.1085)` *exactly* (the
convex combination always dominates this spot-check term), so the strict provable
ceiling is `2^(-29.1085)` and an honest **lower** bound must round the magnitude
**down**: `29.10`, not the display-rounded `29.11`. This is the same round-down
discipline as the interleaved anchor (`64 → 63.99`); the earlier opaque `sorry`
quoted the table's 2-dp magnitude `29.11`, which is unprovable as a strict bound
(`2^(-29.1085) > 2^(-29.11)`).

**The owed external** (τ-subspace-design `ε_mca`; `koalaFRSEnc_injective` flows in
through the bridge). Below the folded unique-decoding radius the `ε_mca`/`|Λ|`
terms are negligible (`≈ 2^(-166.8)`); like every ArkLib `ε_mca` upper bound this
is a by-design external literature admit (BCHKS25/ACFY25/KKH26 subspace-design
list-decodability), the FRS counterpart of the `koalaIRS` owed `ε_mca`.

**Why folding at fixed `t = 128` is not where FRS wins.** `s = 32` gives only
`≈ 29` provable bits (for `s ≤ 2^4` *no* soundness is provable at `t = 128`).
Folding's payoff is on two other axes: larger folding closes the gap
(`s = 2^12`, `r = 108`: `2^(-118.14)`, a `≈ 10`-bit gap), and the
128-bit-enforcing construction reaches `2^(-128.03)` provable soundness at
repetition `t = 563`, `r = 8`, argument size `417.9 KiB`
(`tab:subspace-design-128bit-security`) — the argument-size metric on which FRS
beats interleaved RS. -/

point — the δ-sweep floor, certified from the spot-check term alone.** As of the
FRS-anchor-reduction session the proof is a **full formalized reduction** (no longer
an opaque `sorry`): `le_bestProvableError` reduces the infimum-`≥` goal to a per-δ
floor over the window `(0, δ_min)`, and at *every* admissible δ the convex
combination dominates its round-2 spot-check term `(1-δ)^t` (drop the nonnegative
`winningSetSoundness` term), which is `≥ (1-δ_min)^128` by monotonicity. The folded
code's **MDS relative distance** `δ_min = 32769/65536` (`koalaFRS_minRelDist`) pins
`1 - δ > 32767/65536`, and `(32767/65536)^128 ≥ 2^(-128.01)` is the sorry-free leaf
`koalaFRS_spotcheck_lb`. So the **only owed external is the folded distance** — no

/-! ## The large-folding row `s = 2^12 = 4096` at `t = 128` — gap-closing

The `s = 32` anchors above sit at the τ-subspace-design operating point `r = 8`,
`δ = 7/48 ≈ 0.146`, the *largest* δ that `s = 2^5` admits: `τ(r+1) = s·ρ/(s−r)`
blows past `1` once `r` grows (for `s ≤ 2^4` *no* `r` gives provable soundness at
all). The provable side is therefore pinned at the low `δ = 0.146`, where
`(1−δ)^128 = (41/48)^128 ≈ 2^(-29)` — and the `98.91`-bit gap to the `≈ 2^(-128)`
attack is *irreducible at `s = 32`* (it is a folding-size limit, not a
missing-citation: no sharper coding-theory bound moves it, because the
subspace-design analysis cannot reach a higher δ at this folding).

**Larger folding closes the gap.** At `s = 2^12 = 4096` the minimizing operating
point is `r = 108` (`tab:subspace-design-security-analysis`), where `τ(r+1) =
4096·(1/2)/(4096−108) = 512/997` and the spot-check base is `1−δ = τ(r+1) +
3/(2r) = 512/997 + 1/72 = 37861/71784 ≈ 0.5274` — *close to capacity* `ρ = 1/2`.
The provable side is then `(37861/71784)^128 ≈ 2^(-118.14)`, a `≈ 10`-bit gap to
the attack. This is the **same** τ-subspace-design `ε_mca` admit family as the
`s = 32` anchor (`ε_mca(C, δ) ≤ (r·|L| + 4r³)/|F|`, ABF26 §6.3.2 / `thm:subspace-
design-mca`); folding does **not** swap in a different (capacity-corollary) bound —
it lets the *operating point itself* climb to high δ, which small `s` cannot.

**Construction scaling (held fixed across the `s`-sweep).** The §6.3.2 example
fixes `|F| = q^6 ≈ 2^186`, message `k = 2^20`, rate `ρ = 1/2`, and the *unfolded*
length `s·|L| = 2^21`; folding `s` then sets `|L| = 2^21/s`. (Validated against
the paper's argument-size column: `R·(256·log|L| + 62·s)` reproduces the table's
`3.91 MiB` for `s = 2^12` only with `|L| = 2^21/s = 2^9`, not `|L| = 2^16`.)
So `s = 2^12` ⇒ `|L| = 2^9 = 512`, `k = 2^20`. The folded MDS distance is then
`δ_min = (|L| − ⌊(k−1)/s⌋)/|L| = (512 − 255)/512 = 257/512` (a degree-`< 2^20`
polynomial has `< 2^20` roots, so `< (2^20−1)/2^12 = 256`, i.e. `≤ 255`, *whole*
folded symbols can vanish — the same count that gives the `s = 32` value

`t=128` point.** The large-folding row of `tab:subspace-design-security-analysis`
(`s = 2^12`, minimizing `r = 108`). Same full-reduction shape as `frsLowerBound`:

1. **Pick `δ := 33923/71784`** — the `r = 108` τ-subspace-design point
   (`τ(r+1) = 4096·(1/2)/(4096−108) = 512/997`, spot-check base `1−δ = τ(r+1) +
   3/(2·108) = 512/997 + 1/72 = 37861/71784`). Admissible: `0 < 33923/71784 <
   δ_min = 257/512` (`koalaFRS12_minRelDist`).
2. **Spot-check** `(1−δ)^128 = (37861/71784)^128 ≤ 2^(-118)·(91/100)`
   (`koalaFRS12_spotcheck`, integer fact).
3. **`winningSetSoundness`** via the proven L6.10 bridge down to `ε_mca + |Λ|/|F|`,
   capped at `2^(-118)·(3/1000)` by the τ-subspace-design admit (actual figure
   `≈ 2^(-142.7)` — `ε_mca ≤ (108·512 + 4·108³)/2^186 ≈ 2^(-163.7)` plus the
   interleaving list term `≈ 2^(-142.7)` — far below the ceiling).
4. Sum `≤ 2^(-118)·(913/1000) ≤ 2^(-118.13)` (`koalaFRS12_combine`).

**Why `118.13`, not the table's `118.14`.** `(37861/71784)^128 = 2^(-118.1376)`,
so the strict provable ceiling rounds the magnitude **down** to `118.13` (the same
round-down discipline as `koalaFRS` `29.11 → 29.10`). The owed external is the
τ-subspace-design `ε_mca` (the **same** admit family as `frsLowerBound`, here at
`r = 108` rather than `r = 8`); `koalaFRS12Enc_injective` flows in through the
